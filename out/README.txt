Assumptions:
Utilities -
	Nonalphanumeric characters delineate tokens.
		Example: [can't] becomes ["can", "t"]
	Spacing in the method printFrequencies(), using
	\t (tab) is allowed to separate the text from
	the frequency.

Palindrome -
	Length of palindromes includes white space
	characters.
	Single letters count as palindromes.
	The same palindrome with different spacing will
	be counted as two distinct palindromes.
		Example:
			text file with the phrases:
				do geese see god
				dog ees ese egod
			Output:
			["do geese see god:1",
			"dog ees ese egod:1"]
